## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Corporate brands with franchise networks need a centralized communication platform to replace fragmented email threads and inconsistent information sharing. Corporate staff can broadcast important updates (advertising campaigns, operational changes, performance metrics) to all locations or target specific franchises. Franchise owners and staff can respond, ask questions, submit required reports, and share files in an organized feed format. The system creates accountability through read receipts, due date tracking, and structured data requests while maintaining proper access control between corporate and franchise levels.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a Corporate Staff member has an important advertising update, **When** they create a global post with attached marketing materials, **Then** all franchise locations receive the update in their feed with read receipt tracking
2. **Given** Corporate needs Q3 financial reports from all locations, **When** they create a structured Request with due date, **Then** franchisees can submit reports through the system and Corporate can track completion status per location
3. **Given** a Franchise Owner receives a targeted update, **When** they reply with questions and attach supporting documents, **Then** Corporate Staff can see the response and continue the conversation thread
4. **Given** a franchise location has submitted their monthly performance report, **When** Corporate reviews and provides feedback, **Then** the franchise can view acknowledgment and comments in their feed
5. **Given** multiple franchise locations are discussing a shared challenge, **When** Corporate enables peer-to-peer communication for that topic, **Then** franchisees can see and respond to each other's comments
6. **Given** a Corporate Admin needs to audit communication activity, **When** they access the audit logs, **Then** they can see who posted, read, acknowledged, and responded to specific messages with timestamps

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a franchise location is sold or closed during an active Request campaign?
- How does the system handle file attachments that exceed size limits or contain potentially malicious content?
- What occurs when Corporate staff accidentally posts sensitive information to the wrong audience?
- How does the system manage read receipts for users who are temporarily inactive or on vacation?
- What happens when multiple franchise owners manage the same location?
- How does the system handle partial report submissions when franchisees save drafts?
